speed, block size, frequency scaling, get the Hz + note when you hover it

Make it scalable and allow hiding all UI elements apart from the actual spectrograph display.

optional frequency grid display with captioned frequencies.

an easy way to pause the spectrograph could be useful to inspect a static image for a while (maybe spacebar?)
